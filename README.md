# Portfolio Application - SvelteKit

Another revamped version of a portfolio website, currently in progress. This version inherits a lot of the same features of 'Movie Game' TMDB API calls based ratings game, firebase hosted blog. Changes include the use of a newstack (SvelteKit), newer design and up to date information.
Work in progress include the addition of Go based functionality for real time user information tracking and for a collaborative document that members can work on simultaneously. I also intend to proactively display hobbies engaged in, and to churn out more written content.
